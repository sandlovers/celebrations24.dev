                <p> My name is Dave Kanaszka and I am the owner of Celebrations24. I started this business at the urging of my friends and fellow church parishioners long ago. Before Celebrations24 was in business,  I was asked to Emcee a fund raiser at my church. I used my friend's equipment and set up for the event and there were fireworks. It was so much fun and such a success that I started doing more events around the church and the community. I started to work weddings for friends and acquaintances  and before you knew it, there was no turning back. Everyone encouraged me to live the dream and use my natural God given talents, and Celebrations24 was born! And I haven't regretted a day of it since. </p>
