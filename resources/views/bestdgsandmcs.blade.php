                <h1> Tampa's 5 STAR Rated DJ's and MC's </h1>

                <p> <strong> Why are Celebrations24 Wedding DJ/MC's the Best in Tampa Bay? </strong> </p>

                <p> The Wedding DJ/MC is, undoubtedly, the most important vendor that you will hire.  For your day to be perfect, the DJ/MC must be professional, trained, certified, experienced and in love with the wedding business. The DJ/MC is the one who will control the flow of the day, help organize the other vendors to make sure that they are on the same page, make appropriate announcements, entertain your guests, and help determine whether or not your guests will have fun or if they head home early!  The DJ/MC represents YOU and is in front of your friends and family all day long. The DJ/MC must be able to read a crowd and determine what THEY like.  The bride and groom and their guests are there to enjoy themselves and it's the job of he Wedding DJ/MC to make sure that happens.   At weddings that there is not a wedding planner, the DJ/MC acts in that capacity as well.  At Celebrations24, all of our DJ's are well trained in this aspect as well.  If you like, we will create a timeline for you and help you organize the entire reception, all included in our service! Below, you can meet some of our DJ/MC's by watching their short video interviews. All of these videos were filmed by Team Brad! </p>
